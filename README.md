## How To Use

1. Disable your Anti-Virus, the program can't open because the DLLs have some false positives witch restrict the program to work
2. [Set a folder exclusion](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-exclude-files-and-folders-windows-defender-antivirus-scans) for the folder so it won't delete anything after a few minutes

## Notes
- On wednesdays, Roblox updates which will cause the DLL to not work for a few hours until it is updated by the DLL developer. The DLL will auto update remotely, so all you need to do is just wait.

- You have a chance of getting yourself banned if using this because it injects Roblox's game engine, you must use this at your own risk 

### If your application is not working, try the below:

Install the following files, run the files, then restart your PC.

[Installation #1](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

[Installation #2](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
